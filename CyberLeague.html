            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                Development started in unity using C# as the primary programming language.
                I started making the game in early 2021, focusing on core mechanics and multiplayer functionality.
                Over time, I refined the gameplay, added new features, and optimized performance to ensure a smooth gaming experience.
                The game is continuously updated based on player feedback and emerging trends in the FPS genre.
                we then lost the project files due to a hard drive failure in late 2023.
                and recently restarted development in mid 2025. this time not on my own but with a small team.

                Me, The lead developer and programmer.

                this time around we are aiming to make CyberLeague a more polished and expansive experience, with plans for regular content updates and community events.
